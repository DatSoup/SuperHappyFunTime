# SuperHappyFunTime
This is my very first personal project in programming. This is not something which school or my mentor is telling me to do. This is my idea born of my own free will.

(Okay, maybe my mentor mentioned I need more practice in raw programming and decided this is what I am going to do)

The source code is written in python, and the intention of this program is to be a story/game. I am extremely excited to dive into this as my first passion project!
To clarify, the idea here is to guide the player through a story that I have created (sort of like a DM). To start, the player will select a race and a class.
Each combination of race/class will have a different starting point in the journey. That said, this is just the start of what will be a long process of world building.
For anyone who has any interest in trying this at the early stages, dragonkin HexTinker is the first race/class combo I am making which will be playable.
