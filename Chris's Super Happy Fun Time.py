'''
This is my very first project that I have ever undertaken alone in programming. I am extremely excited and motivated to begin writting
This enchanting tale. My intention here Is to guide the player through a story that I have created. To start, the player will
select a race and a class. Leading on different journeys for each path (This will require a lot of time to properly build each path). 
The first path I am building is the dragonkin HexTinker. If you are interested in playing an early version this is where you will start!
